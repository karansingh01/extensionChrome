Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you Hang by Your Teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.

Hot to talk to anyone: They pay close attention to your instinctive body reactions. They watch to see how fully you are facing them and just how far forward or back you’re leaning while answering their questions. They check out your hands. Are they softly open, palms up, signifying acceptance of the ideas they’re expressing? Or are you making a slight fist, knuckles out, signalling rejection? They scrutinize your face for the split seconds you break eye contact when discussing relevant subjects like your feelings on big awards for damages, or the death penalty.

Deep work: Now take a look at whatever you say is stopping you from creating and living this life. Write out the list of barriers, obstacles, or unfinished things that surface in your awareness. Make a note of everything you say is in the way, or everything you say has to be done first before you go about living your dream life.

Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

Deep Work: CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.

Deep Work: A newfound devotee of deep work, he rented an apartment across the street from his office, allowing him to show up early in the morning before anyone else arrived and work without distraction. “On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting,”

The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

Deep Work: Why have Silver, Hansson, and Doerr done so well? There are two types of answers to this question. The first are micro in scope and focus on the personality traits and tactics that helped drive this trio’s rise. The second type of answers are more macro in that they focus less on the individuals and more on the type of work they represent.

Deep Work: In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.

Deep Work: Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy The ability to quickly master hard things. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

Deep Work: This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated. 

Hooked: 1. Trigger A trigger is the actuator of behavior—the spark plug in the engine.Triggers come in two types: external and internal.8 Habit-forming products start by alerting users with external triggers like an e-mail, a Web site link, or the app icon on a phone. 

Hooked: 2. Action Following the trigger comes the action: the behavior done in anticipation of a reward. 

Hooked: 3. Variable Reward What distinguishes the Hooked Model from a plain vanilla feedback loop is the Hook’s ability to create a craving. Feedback loops are all around us, but predictable ones don’t create desire.  

Hooked: Although dopamine is often wrongly categorized as making us feel good, introducing variability does create a focused state, which suppresses the areas of the brain associated with judgment and reason while activating the parts associated with wanting and desire.

How to Talk to Anyone: ‘The study went on to say a big, warm smile is an asset. But only when it comes a little slower, because then it has more credibility.’ From that moment on, Missy explained, she gave clients and business associates her big smile. However, she trained her lips to erupt more slowly. Thus her smile appeared more sincere and personalized for the recipient.

How to Talk to Anyone: Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes.

How to Talk to Anyone: Sticky eyes also means intelligent eyes There is yet another argument for intense eye contact. In addition to awakening feelings of respect and affection, maintaining strong eye contact gives you the impression of being an intelligent and abstract thinker.

How to Talk to Anyone: Hang by your teeth Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through.

You are now ready to float into the room

How to Talk to Anyone: Limit the fidget Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch.

How to Talk to Anyone: talking, keep your eyes on your listeners and watch how they’re responding to what you’re saying. Don’t miss a trick. Are they smiling? Are they nodding? Are their palms up? They like what they’re hearing. Are they frowning? Are they looking away? Are their knuckles clenched? Maybe they don’t. Are they rubbing their necks? Are they stepping back? Are their feet pointing toward the door? Maybe they want to get away.

How to Talk to Anyone: When they think you’re a pain in the neck they rub theirs. When they feel superior to you, they steeple their hands.

How to Talk to Anyone: Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly.

How to Talk to Anyone: Sports psychologists tell us visualization is not just for top-level competitive athletes. Studies show mental rehearsal helps weekend athletes sharpen their golf, their tennis, their running, whatever their favourite activity. Experts agree if you see the pictures, hear the sounds, and feel the movements of your body in your mind before you do the activity, the effect is powerful.

How to Talk to Anyone: Visualization works best when you feel totally relaxed. Only when you have a calm state of mind can you get clear, vivid images.

How to Talk to Anyone: Always wear a Whatzit Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. ‘Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your … what IS that?’

How to Talk to Anyone: Whoozat? Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by nonpoliticians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.

How to Talk to Anyone: Eavesdrop in No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with ‘Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear …’

How to Talk to Anyone: Each time, through a series of nods and comforting grunts like ‘um hum,’ or ‘umm,’ you let your Conversation Partner know the ball has landed in your court. It’s your ‘I got it’ signal. Such is the rhythm of conversation.

How to Talk to Anyone: Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your Conversation Partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen.

How to Talk to Anyone: The sweetest sound your Conversation Partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is ‘Tell them about the time you …’ Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you.

How to Talk to Anyone: The latest news … don’t leave home without it The last move to make before leaving for the party

How to Talk to Anyone: You simply practise the following eight words. All together now: ‘How … do … you … spend … most … of … your … time?’ ‘How do you spend most of your time?’ is the gracious way to let a cadaver cutter, a tax collector, or a capsized employee off the hook.

How to Talk to Anyone: You don’t need to be quite so melodramatic in your self-image, but at least punch up your life to sound interesting and dedicated.

How to Talk to Anyone: Before responding to ‘What do you do?’ ask yourself, ‘What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?’

How to Talk to Anyone: For example, if you turn to the word smart, you’ll find dozens of synonyms. There are colourful, rich words like ingenious, resourceful, adroit, shrewd, and many more. Run down the list and say each out loud. Which ones fit your personality? Which ones seem right for you? Try each

How to Talk to Anyone: During my seminars, to help men avoid Gary’s mistake, I ask every male to think of a synonym for pretty, or great. Then I bring up one woman and several men. I ask each to pretend he is her husband. She has just come down the stairs ready to go out to dinner. I ask each to take her hand and deliver his compliment. ‘Darla,’ one says, ‘you look elegant.’

How to Talk to Anyone: Don’t tell the hosts it was wonderful. Everybody says that. Tell them it was a splendid party, a superb party, an extraordinary party. Hug the hosts and tell them you had a magnificent time, a remarkable time, a glorious time. The first few times you say a word like glorious, it may not roll comfortably off your tongue. Yet you have no trouble with the word wonderful.

How to Talk to Anyone: Whenever someone mentions a common interest or experience, instead of jumping in with a breathless, ‘Hey, me, too! I do that, too’ or ‘I know all about that,’ let your Conversation Partner enjoy talking about it. Let her go on about the country club before you tell her you’re a member, too.

How to Talk to Anyone: Here’s the technique I call Kill the Quick ‘Me, Too!’ Whenever people mention an activity or interest you share, let them enjoy discussing their passion. Then, when the time is right, casually mention you share their interest.

How to Talk to Anyone: Comm-YOU-nicate when you want a favour Putting YOU first gets a much better response, especially when you’re asking a favour, because it pushes the asker’s pride button. Suppose you want to take a long weekend. You decide to ask your boss if you can take Friday off. Which request do you think he or she is going to react to more positively? ‘Can I take Friday off, Boss?’ Or this one: ‘Boss, can YOU do without me Friday?’

How to Talk to Anyone: Comm-YOU-nicate your compliments Comm-YOU-nication also enriches your social conversation. Gentlemen, say a lady likes your suit. Which woman gives you warmer feelings? The woman who says, ‘I like your suit.’ Or the one who says, ‘YOU look great in that suit.’ Big Players who make business presentations use Comm-YOU-nication to excellent advantage. Suppose you’re giving a talk and a participant asks a question. He likes to hear you say, ‘That’s a good question.’ However, consider how much better he feels when you tell him, ‘YOU’VE asked a good question.’

How to Talk to Anyone: Why did this man’s stock shoot high in my ticker one minute and plummet the next? Because his smile, although charming, reflected no special reaction to me. Obviously, he gave the same smile to everybody and, by that, it lost all its specialness. If Strobe Man had given each of us a slightly different smile, he would have appeared sensitive and insightful. (Of course, if his smile had been just a tad bigger for me than for the others, I couldn’t have waited for the formalities to be over to seek him out in the crowded ballroom.)

How to Talk to Anyone: When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty Big Players find in each new face. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.

How to Talk to Anyone: The difference is, these jawsmiths use it all. They use their hands, they use their bodies, and they use specific gestures with heavy impact.

How to Talk to Anyone: He’d describe being nervous about losing his job as ‘I felt like an elephant dangling over a cliff with his tail tied to a daisy.’ Instead of saying he looked at a pretty woman, he’d say, ‘My eyeballs popped out and dangled by the optic nerve.’

How to Talk to Anyone: Many speakers use author’s and speaker’s agent Lilly Walters’s face-saver lines from her book, What to Say When You’re Dying on the Platform.16 If you tell a joke and no one laughs, try ‘That joke was designed to get a silent laugh – and it worked.’ If the microphone lets out an agonizing howl, look at it and say, ‘I don’t understand. I brushed my teeth this morning.’ If someone asks you a question you don’t want to answer, ‘Could you save that question until I’m finished – and well on my way home?’ All pros think of holes they might fall into and then memorize great escape lines. You can do the same. Look through books of similes to enrich your day-to-day conversations. Instead of happy as a lark try ‘happy as a lottery winner’ or ‘happy as a baby with its first ice cream cone.’

How to Talk to Anyone: always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it.

How to Talk to Anyone: The broken record Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off.

How to Talk to Anyone: Very simply, never let the word thank you stand naked and alone. Always make it thank you for something. People use the bare exposed thank you so often that people don’t even hear it anymore.

How to Talk to Anyone: Whenever the occasion warrants more than an unconscious acknowledgment, dress up your thank you with the reason: Thank you for coming. Thank you for being so understanding. Thank you for waiting. Thank you for being such a good customer.

How to Talk to Anyone: Scramble Therapy is, quite simply, scrambling up your life and participating in an activity you’d never think of indulging in.

How to Talk to Anyone: It’s all in the opening question. For example, suppose I’m introduced to someone and the first words out of her mouth are, ‘Oh, you’re a writer. When are you going to write the great American novel?’ Yikes, I know I’m talking with someone who is unfamiliar with my world. 
If, however, my new acquaintance says, ‘Oh you’re a writer. Do you write fiction or nonfiction?’ Bingo! Now I know I’m with a person who knows about my world. Why? Because that is the first question all writers ask each other. I enjoy talking to this inquisitor because I presume she has more insights into the writing world.

How to Talk to Anyone: When an astronaut meets another astronaut, he asks, ‘What missions have you been on?’ (Never ‘How do you go to the bathroom up there?’) A dentist asks another dentist, ‘Are you in general practice or do you have a specialty?’

How to Talk to Anyone: Then, here’s the fun part, when you tell them you’re not connected to their field, they’re all the more impressed. ‘What a knowledgeable person!’ they say to themselves.

How to Talk to Anyone: find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons.
considered ‘an act of God.’ Therefore, you lose. When knowledgeable associates buy products, the vendor is happily reduced to nothing more than a purchasing agent. For very little work, he makes a small profit and is satisfied. A little bit of knowledge goes a long way when you’re buying something. If you have insight into your real estate broker’s bottom line, he’s more apt to give you the better price. If you are facile with the insider words caterers and car salesmen use to pad their profits, if you’re

How to Talk to Anyone: However, when quizzed afterward on how much they liked each other, partners who believed they were similar liked each other a lot more than the couples who thought themselves to be dissimilar, demonstrating we have a predisposition toward people we believe are just like us. We are most comfortable giving our business and friendship to those we feel share our values and beliefs in life.

How to Talk to Anyone: Be a copycat Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your Conversation Partner subliminally real comfy with you.

How to Talk to Anyone: When you want to give someone the subliminal feeling you’re just alike, use their words, not yours. Suppose you are selling a car to a young mother who tells you she is concerned about safety because she has a young toddler.

How to Talk to Anyone: You are first chatting with a lawyer who tells you her profession is often maligned. When it comes your turn to speak, say profession too. If you say job, it puts a subconscious barrier between you. Next you meet a construction worker who starts talking about his job.

How to Talk to Anyone: What are empathizers? Empathizers are simple, short, supportive statements. Unlike ‘uh huh,’ they are complete sentences such as ‘I can appreciate you decided to do that,’ or ‘That really is exciting.’ Empathizers can be one-sentence positive critiques like ‘Yes, that was the honorable thing to do’ or ‘It’s charming you felt that way.’ When you respond with complete sentences instead of the usual grunts, not only do you come across as more articulate, your listener feels that you really understand.

How to Talk to Anyone: What part of their anatomy are your associates talking though? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make

How to Talk to Anyone: Don’t directly compliment Jane. Go to her close associate Diane Doe and say, ‘You know, Jane is a very dynamic woman. She said something so brilliant in the meeting the other day. Someday she’ll be running this company.’ I place ten-to-one odds your comment will

How to Talk to Anyone: When there’s bad news. (It’s called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the Carrier Pigeon of kind thoughts.

How to Talk to Anyone: Rule 1: Deliver your Killer Compliment to the recipient in private. If you are standing with a group of four or five people and you praise one woman for being fit, every other woman feels like a barrel of lard. If you tell one man he has wonderful carriage, every other feels like a hunchback. You also make the blushing

How to Talk to Anyone: Rule 2: Make your Killer Compliment credible. For example, I’m tone-deaf. If I’m forced to sing even a simple song like ‘Happy Birthday,’ I sound like a sick pig. If anyone in earshot were foolish enough to tell me they liked my voice, I’d know it was hogwash. Rule 3: Confer only one Killer Compliment per half year on each recipient. Otherwise you come across as insincere, grovelling, obsequious, pandering, and a thoroughly

How to Talk to Anyone: Your colleague asks, ‘How was your vacation in Hawaii?’ You answer, ‘Oh, you remembered I went to Hawaii! It was great, thanks.’ Your boss asks, ‘Are you over your cold now?’ You answer, ‘I appreciate your concern. I feel much better now.’ Whenever someone shines a little sunshine on your life in the form of a compliment or concerned question,

How to Talk to Anyone: Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but don’t mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say ‘I appreciate you’ or ‘I love you,’ fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier.

How to Talk to Anyone: To get your personality across on the phone, you must translate your emotions into sound. In fact, you have to exaggerate the sound because studies have shown people lose 30 per cent of the energy level in their voices on the phone. Say you meet an important new

How to Talk to Anyone: punctuate your phone conversations with ‘Uh huh’ or ‘I hear you.’ So your listener knows you’re nodding in approval, verbalize ‘I see,’ ‘Oh that’s great,’ ‘No kidding,’ ‘Interesting,’ and ‘Tell me more!’ She didn’t see you hitting your head in surprise? Better say ‘What a surprise!’

How to Talk to Anyone: Saying a person’s name too often in face-to-face conversation sounds manipulative. However, on the phone the effect is dramatically different.

How to Talk to Anyone: Don’t answer the phone with an ‘I’m just sooo happy all the time’ attitude. Answer warmly, crisply, professionally. Then, after you hear who is calling, let a huge smile of happiness engulf your entire face and spill over into your voice. You make your caller feel as though your giant warm fuzzy smile is reserved for him or her.

How to Talk to Anyone: When you hear a phone in the background, stop speaking – in midsentence if necessary – and say ‘I hear your other line’ (or your dog barking, your baby crying, your spouse calling you).

How to Talk to Anyone: Biggies get there early to start hitting their marks as each arrives. VIPS frequently come early to get their business done before party regulars who ‘hate to be the first one there’ start arriving. They are never embarrassed to arrive early.

How to Talk to Anyone: Think again, thespians. It’s cultivated. Politicians don’t just slink unnoticed into a roomful of people. Politicians make The Entrance. With one simple technique, you too can make great entrances. I call it Rubberneck the Room. Before entering, stop dramatically in the doorway and survey the scene s-l-o-w-l-y with your eyes. It is significant that, while you’re standing in the doorway, you’re not thinking, ‘Look at me.’ The reason you’re Rubbernecking the Room is not to show off. It is so you can diagnose the situation you’re walking into. Take note of the lighting, the bar, and most important, the faces. Listen to the music, the buzz of the crowd, the clinking of glasses. See who is talking to whom. While rubbernecking, you’ll also be using Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee, the next technique, which helps you select your first, second, and maybe third target. Now,

How to Talk to Anyone: ‘Hmm, any interesting strangers I should meet?’ Politicians don’t wait for others to approach them. If the party host or their campaign manager has not supplied a ‘must meet’ list, they choose their targets while Rubbernecking the Room. As their keen eyes scan the crowd, they’re asking themselves ‘Who would I most enjoy talking'

How to Talk to Anyone: When you seek people’s special qualities by exploring their faces, you will find them. If you want to walk out of any gathering with your life enhanced, spend time with people you choose, not just those who choose you. Be choosey in who you pick. But don’t wait to be the choosee.

How to Talk to Anyone: Controlled studies show that party goers are more comfortable approaching people who stand with an open body – arms uncrossed and hanging at their sides, legs slightly separated, a slight smile on their faces. Any object between you and the crowd is a subliminal cutoff – even your purse. More people approach a woman who sports a shoulder bag than one squeezing a handbag. The shoulder bag hangs behind her back, thus leaving the path to talk to her open. Give

How to Talk to Anyone: They also signify acceptance. When you are listening to a business colleague to whom you want to signal acceptance, make sure your wrists and palms are up.

How to Talk to Anyone: Tracking Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your Conversation Partners’ lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a powerful sense of intimacy. When you envoke the last major or minor event in anyone’s life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom.

How to Talk to Anyone: Right after you’ve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation:

How to Talk to Anyone: At that instant, I realized Big Boys and Girls see no bloopers, hear no bloopers. They never say ‘Butterfingers.’ Or ‘Whoops.’ Or even ‘Uh-oh.’ They ignore their colleagues’ boners. They simply don’t notice their comrades’ minor spills, slips, fumbles and blunders. Thus, the technique See No Bloopers, Hear No Bloopers was born.

How to Talk to Anyone: Whenever someone’s story is aborted, let the interruption play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, ‘Now please get back to your story.’ Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, ‘So what happened after the … (and fill in the last few

How to Talk to Anyone: (and WIIFY) Whenever you suggest a meeting or ask a favour, divulge the respective benefits. Reveal what’s in it for you and what’s in it for the other person – even if it’s zip. If any hidden agenda comes up later, you get labelled a sly fox.

How to Talk to Anyone: Whenever you make a mistake, make sure your victim benefits. It’s not enough to correct your error. Ask yourself, ‘What could I do for this suffering soul so he or she will be delighted I made the flub?’ Then do it, fast! In that way, your goof will become your gain.

How to Talk to Anyone: Dear (name of supervisor), I know how important customer service is to an organization such as yours. This letter is to commend (name of employee).

The Sleep Solution: One last thing about the glymphatic system: it seems to work better when you sleep on your side. Stony Brook University researchers Hedok Lee and colleagues studying rodents found that the glymphatic system worked more efficiently when the rodent was placed on its side. One behavioral change you can implement right now that could reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is to simply sleep on your side.

The Sleep Solution: Their sleep and brain biochemistry were measured. Did the rats sleep? Absolutely. Did they both sleep the same? No. The rats in the dirty cage showed more signs of hyperarousal and did not sleep as well as the rats in the clean cage. 

Deep work:  As of now, spend a minimum of one hour a day doing whatever you are waiting to do

Deep work:  Spend at least one hour a day doing whatever you simply love to do—what you deeply feel you need to do, in your heart—in spite of the daily duties that seem to constrain you.

Deep work:  Most postponements are excuses for a lack of creative discipline.

Deep work:  Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose.

Deep work:  A man must love his father and yet be free of his father's expectations and criticisms in order to be a free man.

Deep work:  He shouldn't pretend he is more enlightened than he is—nor should he stop short of his actual edge. The more a man is playing his real edge, the more valuable he is as good company for other men, the more he can be trusted to be authentic and fully present. Where a man's edge is located is less important than whether he is actually living his edge in truth, rather than being lazy or deluded.

Deep work:  If you were absolutely fearless, would you be earning a living in exactly the same way as you are now? Your edge is where you stop short, or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to your fears.

Deep work:  Honor your edge. Honor your choices. Be honest with yourself about them. Be honest with your friends about them. A fearful man who knows he is fearful is far more trustable than a fearful man who isn't aware of his fear. And a fearful man who still leans into his fear, living at his edge and putting his gift out from there, is more trustworthy and more inspirational than a fearful man who hangs back in the comfort zone, unwilling to even experience his fear on a day to day level.

Deep work:  Spend time with people who inspire you and reflect the source to you. Meditate, contemplate, or pray daily so that you steep yourself in the source.

Deep work:  Even if you find yourself in some trivial moment, watching TV or cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, feel the truth of who you are. Feel the boundless cognizance in which each instant seems and vanishes.

Deep work:  Always trust your own wisdom

Deep work: Good friends should not tolerate mediocrity in one another.

Deep work: You may wish to go on a retreat in a remote area and be by yourself. Whatever it is you decide to do, consciously keep yourself open and available to receiving a vision of what is next. It will come.

Deep work: And then, one day, a few years later, it is finished. This layer has dissolved. And the cycle begins again, and again, until you have penetrated all the layers into your deepest purpose. Then, you act fully, until that purpose, too, is dissolved in the bliss of the love that you are.

Ikigai: Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular, moderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of the joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and cherishing each new day is their ikigai.

Ikigai: According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties ”that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations. Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.

Ikigai: Fill your belly to 80 percent.  Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.  

Ikigai: The effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated. According to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book Maximum Brainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom,

Ikigai: One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.

Ikigai: we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits: Walk to work, or just go on a walk for at least twenty minutes each day. Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator. This is good for your posture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things. Participate in social or leisure activities so that you don't spend too much time in front of the television. Replace your junk food with fruit and you'll have less of an urge to snack, and more nutrients in your system.

Ikigai: Get the right amount of sleep. Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than that makes us lethargic. Play with children or pets, or join a sports team. This not only strengthens the body but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem. Be conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and replace them with more positive ones.

Ikigai: Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep we generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles. A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the following benefits: It strengthens the immune system. It contains an element that protects against cancer. It promotes the natural production of insulin. It slows the onset of Alzheimer's disease. It helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease.

Ikigai: that the people who live the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way toward longevity.

Ikigai: A stoic attitude ”serenity in the face of a setback ”can also help keep you young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate lifestyles.

Ikigai: Logotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life's purpose in order to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates them to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming whatever obstacles they encounter along the way.

Ikigai: Nietzsches famous aphorisms: He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.

Ikigai: We dont create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed we discover it. We each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or transformed many times over the years. Just as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared, excessive attention to a desire (or hyper-intention) can keep that desire from being fulfilled. Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety. We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find ourselves. 

Ikigai: The basic principles of Morita therapy Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense.

Ikigai: We should focus instead on the present moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we should avoid intellectualizing the situation.

Ikigai: We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. Aristotle

Ikigai: We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we notice the sunset and realize we havent eaten dinner. We go surfing and dont realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our muscles ache.

Ikigai: The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow According to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the requirements for achieving flow are: Knowing what to do Knowing how to do it Knowing how well you are doing Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved) Perceiving significant challenges Perceiving significant skills Being free from distractions

Ikigai: Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too difficult!), Strategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective. We should ask ourselves questions such as: What is my objective for todays session in the studio? How many words am I going to write today for the article coming out next month? What is my teams mission?

Ikigai: As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity youre doing. Getting back to Albert Einstein, happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.

Ikigai: Strategy 3: Concentrate on a single task This is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much technology and so many distractions. Were listening to a video on YouTube while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it.

Ikigai: Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow. According to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need: To be in a distraction-free environment To have control over what we are doing at every moment Technology is great,

Ikigai: Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.

Ikigai: Dont look at any kind of screen for the first hour youre awake and the last hour before you go to sleep. Turn off your phone before you achieve flow. There is nothing more important than the task you have chosen to do during this time. Designate one day of the week, perhaps a Saturday or Sunday, a day of technological fasting, making exceptions only for e-readers (without Wi-Fi) or MP3 players. Go to a cafe that doesnt have Wi-Fi. Read and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times clearly and stick to them.

Ikigai:  Try the Pomodoro Technique and commit to working on a single task as long as its running. The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest. Find the pace thats best for you; the most important thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle.

Ikigai: Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward. Train your mind to return to the present when you find yourself getting distracted. Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a walk or a swim whatever will help you get centered again. Work in a space where you will not be distracted. If you cant do this at home, go to a library, a cafe. keep looking until you find the right place. 

Ikigai: Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its own place and time. For example, if youre writing a magazine article, you could do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library in the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night.

Ikigai: When he didnt have something important to do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing” say, painting the office walls.

Ikigai: If we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent antidote to our smartphones

Ikigai: Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in meditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a beginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a hot bath.

Ikigai: yourself: Rituals over goals. The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.

Ikigai: After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just to think?

Ikigai: Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai.

Ikigai: Stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time

Ikigai: Food wont help you live longer she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the diminutive confection that followed our meal. The secret is smiling and having a good time

Ikigai: Celebrate each day, together Celebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi.

Ikigai: Dont worry the secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young dont let it grow old. Open your heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your grandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.

Ikigai: The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go out there and say, Hello and See you later Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the afternoon, I spend time with friends

Ikigai: To live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well, and spend time with people

Ikigai: Nurture your friendships every day Getting together with my friends is my most important ikigai. We all get together here and talk its very important. I always know Ill see them all here tomorrow, and thats one of my favorite things in life

Ikigai: Live an unhurried life My secret to a long life is always saying to myself, Slow down and Relax. You live much longer if youre not in a hurry

Ikigai: Doing many different things every day. Always staying busy, but doing one thing at a time, without getting overwhelmed

Ikigai: The secret to long life is going to bed early, waking up early, and going for a walk. Living peacefully and enjoying the little things. Getting along with your friends. Spring, summer, fall, winter enjoying each season, happily

Ikigai: Be optimistic Every day I say to myself, Today will be full of health and energy. Live it to the fullest

Ikigai: Keys to the Ogimi Lifestyle One hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable garden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa, and so on.

Ikigai: All belong to some form of neighborhood association, where they feel cared for as though by family.

Ikigai: They celebrate all the time, even little things. Music, song, and dance are essential parts of daily life. They have an important purpose in life, or several. They have an ikigai, but they don't take it too seriously. They are relaxed and enjoy all that they do.

Ikigai: They are very proud of their traditions and local culture.

Ikigai: They are passionate about everything they do, however insignificant it might seem.

Ikigai: They are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow them to relax. We didnt see a single old grandpa sitting on a bench doing nothing. They're always coming and going ”to sing karaoke, visit with neighbors, or play a game of gateball.

Ikigai: Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be key. A study of Okinawas centenarians showed that they ate 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our fast-food culture.

Ikigai: eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to make sure you  re eating the rainbow.  A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example

Ikigai: They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, its cane sugar. We drove through several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.

Ikigai: They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per day, compared to an average of 12.

Ikigai: White tea, with its high concentration of polyphenols, may be even more effective against aging. In fact, it is considered to be the natural product with the greatest antioxidant power in the world to the extent that one cup of white tea might pack the same punch as about a dozen glasses of orange juice. In summary: Drinking green or white tea every day can help us reduce the free radicals in our bodies, keeping us young longer.

Ikigai: The Antioxidant Canon, for Westerners In 2010 the UKs Daily Mirror published a list of foods recommended by experts to combat aging. Among these foods readily available in the West are: Vegetables such as broccoli and chard, for their high concentration of water, minerals, and fiber Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines, for all the antioxidants in their fat Fruits such as citrus, strawberries, and apricots; they are an excellent source of vitamins and help eliminate toxins from the body Berries such as blueberries and goji berries; they are rich in phytochemical antioxidants Dried fruits, which contain vitamins and antioxidants, and give you energy Grains such as oats and wheat, which give you energy and contain minerals Olive oil, for its antioxidant effects that show in your skin

Ikigai: Foods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed baked goods, and prepared foods, along with cows milk and all its derivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the process of premature aging.

Ikigai: As Easy as Getting out of Your Chair Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they're almost stupid,  says Gavin Bradley in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.2 Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.

Ikigai:  It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using computers, when using smartphones, when reading books.

Ikigai: Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life's ups and downs.

Ikigai: Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune. They concentrate on the things they can control and don't worry about those they can't.

Ikigai: Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there is nothing wrong with enjoying life's pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to disappear.

Ikigai: The Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth pursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility (apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, and gratitude. In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them. To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without worrying about them.

Ikigai: Seneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was, nonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization every night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative situations, he actually put them into practice for example, by living for a week without servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a result, he was able to answer the question What's the worst thing that could happen?

Ikigai: another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we can't, as we see in the Serenity Prayer. Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can't, which in turn will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions

Ikigai: In the words of Epictetus, It's not what happens to you, but how you react that matters

Ikigai: Both Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.

Ikigai: In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on the impermanence of the things around us. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said that changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the essence of the universe

Ikigai: We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who surround us.

Ikigai: A complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be translated as  This moment exists only now and won't come again. It is heard most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter whether with friends, family, or strangers is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or the future.

Ikigai: As Taleb writes in Antifragile, We need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living.

Ikigai: Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an eternity.

Ikigai: Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; dont let them take over your life.

Ikigai: Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.

Ikigai: Stay active; don't retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That's why it's so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others

Ikigai: Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes,  Walk slowly and you'll go far. When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.

Ikigai: instead of stuffing ourselves. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . in other words, living. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn't stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.

Ikigai: Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing it also helps make friends. It's good to recognize the things that aren't so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it

Ikigai: is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.

Ikigai: Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world.

Ikigai: Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks.

Ikigai: Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.

Ikigai: Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you dont know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover

The Alchemist: And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.

The Alchemist: It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting

The Alchemist: I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.

The Alchemist: “What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely surprised. “It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”

The Alchemist: Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. “At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.

The Alchemist: The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”

The Alchemist: He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.

The Alchemist: “Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above all, don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion.

The Alchemist: “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”

The Alchemist: As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure. “I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.

The Alchemist: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose,

The Alchemist: He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just anyone!

The Alchemist: “In alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s always a positive force.” He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or animal—or even just a simple thought.

The Alchemist: The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s daily life.

The Alchemist: The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own way of learning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal Legends, and I respect him for that.”

The Alchemist: I’m eating, that’s all I think about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other. “Because I don’t live in either my past or my future.

The Alchemist: I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand fes-tival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”

The Alchemist: He still had a long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the party the camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle. The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.

The Alchemist: “This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.”

The Alchemist: How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”

The Alchemist: “I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would understand.” The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy relaxed. “I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”

The Alchemist: Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense. “Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse.

The Alchemist: “There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey.

The Alchemist: “Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when they had made camp that day. “Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your treasure.” “But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.” “Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”

The Alchemist: “Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.” “You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?” “Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them. “You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.” The

The Alchemist: “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”

The Alchemist: We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.

The Alchemist: The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.

The Alchemist: “To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist answered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”

The Alchemist: “Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”

The Alchemist: The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it.” The boy smiled.
